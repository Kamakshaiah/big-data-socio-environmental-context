,,Abstract
S,1,"Purpose: This study conducts a systematic review using 452 academic and industry articles from an initial set of 60,899 records obtained by 3 databases from 2012 to 2020. The authors compare and contrast blockchains with existing legacy systems. The authors identify existing regulation, accounting standards, guidelines and potential amendments in under-explored areas such as taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed auditing procedures. The study aims to highlight the trends, differences and gaps between academic and industry literature. The authors provide a behavioral, social, cultural, organizational, regulatory, ethical, accountability and managerial perspectives of blockchain adoption in accounting. Finally, the study develops two adoption frameworks. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' study follows (Moher et al., 2009) and (Briner and Denyer, 2012) methodology to conduct the systematic review and the steps are mentioned below. The authors construct a final sample of 452 from a preliminary search of three multi-disciplinary databases from 2012 to 2020. First, the authors motivate the review and formulate the research questions. Second, the authors aggregate relevant literature from both industry and academia and implement quality assessments. Third, the authors analyze the literature and construct the final sample of articles. Fourth, the authors conducted textual analysis, keyword frequencies and identify gaps, trends and similarities between academic and industry literature and develop the authors' frameworks Findings: The authors identify 3 (ABDC, B and A* ranked) journals as publishing top article numbers with the highest article count for 2017 with 96 articles in academia and 2019 for the industry with 21 articles. Second-highest publications for academia occur in 2018 with 77 followed by, whereas in the industry, publications occur in the year 2016 with 16 articles. Two co-authors appear most popular with 103 articles. Word clouds, a mind map and article theme counts are used to identify nine key research clusters: data management, financial applications, sustainability, accounting and auditing, business and industrial, education, governance, privacy/security and disruptive technology. Research limitations/implications: Systematic reviews can have selection biases mainly due to search and selection criteria distortions when constructing the final sample of articles. The authors address selection bias by refining our search keyword combinations by using different permutations and using keywords from articles already collected. The authors employ three databases and review the reference list of articles collected to add more articles that may have been missed into our sample. In addition, to avoid inconsistent coding of domains/themes and interpretations, the authors carefully review our domain identifications and all our analysis twice independently using two research assistants to obtain the same conclusions. Practical implications: The authors' unique contributions include reviewing additional papers, differentiating between industry, academic articles, common trends and gaps in much scattered prior literature. The authors identify existing accounting standards, guidelines, limitations and possible amendments required in future for blockchain adoption in accounting in taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed audit procedures. Blockchains are compared with legacy accounting technologies and two frameworks for adoption developed. The authors' results could impact the understanding of existing regulation, accounting standards, future amendments, areas requiring clarity and future collaborative research between academia and industry across multi-disciplines. Practical implications to academics, professional bodies, regulators and industry practitioners exist. Social implications: The authors' study identifies significant implications on organizations, environment, culture and society in general. The authors identify that social engagement projects may be easily initiated and implemented with decentralized accounting information systems. Transparency and efficiency would change organization culture, ways accountants and even employees interact with each other and community. Anonymity in blockchains can be used for criminal activities. Coding of negative social dynamics to smart contracts may persist. Transparency of personally identifiable information may place individuals at risk. Regulation and standards would need to identify equity, ethics in blockchains which notwithstanding energy consumption, and could enable environmental protection increasing societal sustainability. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares academic and industry literature of 452 articles to identify gaps and similarities from 2012 to 2020 using three multi-disciplinary databases. The authors' study is the first study to in detail existing accounting standards, unclear areas, future amendments for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards on taxation, financial reporting and all aspects of auditing procedures. The authors further categorize prior literature into these key areas and develop two frameworks (DAERPS and DAIS) that are linked to our review results and prior literature. The authors identify the impact of blockchain adoption on key stakeholders, regulation, society, culture, organization, accountability and ethics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

China, Nanjing Branch and Wuhan Branch, from the practice perspective. In the future, spatial information technology combining with emerging information technologies, including Big Data, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Augmented Reality (AR) Technique, large distributed and mobile network will improve the reliability of audit evidences and enhance the auditing conclusions and functions, especially resource and environmental auditing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013."
,3,"Assuring future performance of systems-of-systems through advanced-technology investments is a perpetual challenge of industry and agencies. Among the complicating factors are technology innovation, escalating scales, and diversity of software and hardware applications, increasing availability and scrutiny of big data, and evolving business, environmental, and legal contexts. These factors are engaging system owner/operators to continually reprioritize these investments, even as transparent principles for investment are needed for appropriate oversight and auditing. In this paper, a branch of resilience analysis offers to address multiple layers of uncertainty that arise from technology plans around future disruptions to large-scale systems-of-systems. The paper presents a methodology to quantify and manage the disruptive influence of individual systems perspectives to the prioritization of technology investments across the system-of-systems. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study on an information technology investment portfolio of the US Department of Commerce, USA. The experience suggests how fiscal limitations, combining with several other factors, has the largest disruption to the prioritization of investments. The results furthermore describe how investments perform relative to one another and characterize where the system-of-systems might be resilient to the perspectives of constituent systems.

,4,"The use real-time analysis of big data necessitates auditors modify their evidence-gathering procedures of employing continuous auditing in assuring sustainability attributes. We suggest a model that integrates assurance and its continuous auditing into all five economic, governance, social, ethical and environmental (EGSEE) dimensions of sustainability performance reporting. Real-time analysis of big data facilitates more transparent and timely available information for auditors to perform procedures provide reasonable assurance on accuracy, consistency and completeness of information. Big Data is often referred to as electronic data and is the capability of accessing, analysing, and assessing a huge amount of data and transforming them into information in a timely manner for decision making. The application of Big Data and Data Science Analytics to auditing is currently at an early stage. This study examines the real-time analysis of big data, which including evidence-gathering procedures and tests on audit and assurance services for sustainability attributes. We provide policy, practical and educational implications of employing real-time analysis of big data for sustainability performance as the implementation of continues auditing."
W,5,"Cloud-assisted applications have been developed in recent years, especially in servicing the smart city. Cloud computing is an emerging technology, which combines many redundant and distributed servers to provide various applications and services. On the one hand, the users can outsource their data to the cloud and enjoy the services that are provided by the cloud anytime and anywhere. On the other hand, outsourcing the data to the cloud will reduce the local storage burden and alleviate the hardware maintenance. However, the cloud server is semi-trusted, which possibly threaten the data's security. In addition, because the data owner will not physically possess the data after outsourcing the data to the cloud, it is required to check the storage correctness and data integrity. Cloud auditing protocols are proposed to solve this problem, but the efficiency and security of previous protocols are not well. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced auditing protocol, which can reduce the verification cost greatly and offer enough security assurance. Besides, our protocol is able to resist the forgery attack in the proof verification. The security and performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol can efficiently support storage verification and privacy preserving."
,6,"With the rapid development of the economy and society, the sustainable development of resources and environment has been paid more and more attention. As an important part of the national environmental supervision system, resources and environmental audits have attracted great attention from the society. In order to explore the application effect of intelligent networking technology in resource and environment audit, this study carries out monitoring sampling, information collection, and later data processing optimization in resource and environment audit projects through the reference of artificial intelligence technology and method and combined with Internet of things big data analysis, which brings new Turks to the development of natural resource and environment audit and helps to improve the efficiency of audit work. Through the application of new technology in the sampling process of environmental information, the staff use new technology to collect, analyze, and mine data and explore how the new technology can promote the efficiency of resource and environmental audit and better promote the construction of ecological civilization."
,7,"Data provenance is information about where data come from (provenance data) and how they transform (provenance transformation). Data provenance is widely used to evaluate data quality, trace errors, audit data, and understand references among data. Current studies on data provenance in relational database management systems (RDBMS) still have limitations in supporting full-featured SQL or procedural languages. With these challenges in mind, we present a formal definition of provenance data and provenance transformation for relational data. Then, we propose a solution to support data provenance in relational databases, including provenance graphs and provenance routes. Our method not only solves the complicated problem of modeling provenance in DBMS but also is capable of extending procedural languages in SQL. We also present ProvPg, a PostgreSQL-based prototype database system supporting data provenance in multiple granularities. ProvPg implements extraction, calculation, query, and visualization of provenance. We perform TPC-H tests for ProvPg and PostgreSQL, respectively. Experimental results show that ProvPg addresses the vision of supporting data provenance with little extra computation overhead for the execution engine, which indicates that our model is applicable to lineage tracing applications."

,9,"Fragmentation of reformatting trends in corporate reporting, differentiation national approaches to the regulation of accounting systems and the lack of academic studies of accounting innovations cosed an urgent need to identify key innovations in the development of corporate reporting, analyze the feasibility of their use. The aim of the article. The aim of the article is structural analysis of modern innovations in preparing and presenting corporate reporting and researching the prospects of their application based on the theory of diffusion of innovations The results of the analysis. Innovation diffusion theory as in instrument of interdisciplinary analysis allows to describe key parameters in spreading of actual accounting, audit and corporate reporting innovations, for example: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity of innovation, trialability and observability. Located in the order of accounting cycle (accounting of different types of operations, reporting after the end of the period, and rendering an auditors opinion), discussed technological innovations give an idea about the prospects of modern system of corporate reporting. Big data, accounting for Environmental, Social and corporate Governance criteria, preparation and presentation of integrated reporting, real-time reporting, conducting continuous audit with computer assisted audit technologies (CAAT), Global General Accepted Accounting Principles (GGAAP) and development of XBRL are the typical technological innovations that accompany the transformation corporate reporting process based on a new paradigm. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Big data is not only the product of accounting and reporting in real time, but also the basis for the continuous audit of the real-time reporting with advanced analytical technologies CAAT. Taking into account ESG-criteria in the course of business, the implementation of responsible investment requires the development of appropriate indicators and its accounting measurement for the demonstration of progress in achieving sustainability and corporate social responsibility. This ESG-criteria and indicator (non-financial information), spreading real-time reporting lead to the emergence of integrated reporting. It causes changes in approaches to public audit and confirmation of this type of reporting with the CAAT, artificial intelligence systems. GGAAP development, improvement of methodology of integrated reporting standards and International Standards on Quality, Control, Auditing, Review Other Assurance and Related Services acts as a response to the need to restoring confidence in the reporting on globalized financial marketsand independent verification of its quality. XBRL as a technology innovation serving as connecting-link the one that helps transmit understandable reporting to all stakeholders, minimizing the time and costs for its processing and analysis through the taxonomy. The combination of considered innovation are grounded necessitates of construction of convergent model of accounting, reporting and auditing, which fully meets the information needs of stakeholders on globalized financial markets and with the spreading of sustainability concept."
,10,"Waste management directly and indirectly contributes to all sustainable development goals. Hence, the modernisation of the current ineffective management system through Industry 4.0-compatible technologies is urgently needed. Inspired by the fourth industrial revaluation, this study explores the potential application of waste management 4.0 in a local government area in Perth, Western Australia. The study considers a systematic literature review as part of an exploratory investigation of the current applications and practices of Industry 4.0 in the waste industry. Moreover, the study develops and tests a machine learning model to identify and measure household waste contamination as a waste management 4.0 case study application. The study reveals that waste management 4.0 offers various opportunities and sustainability benefits in reducing costs, improving efficiency in the supply chain and material flow, and reducing as well as eliminating waste by achieving holistic circular economy goals. The significant barriers and challenges involve initial investments in developing and maintaining waste management 4.0 technology, platform and data acquisition. The proof-of-concept case study on the machine learning model detects selected waste with considerable precision (over 70% for selected items). The number and quality of the labelled data significantly influences the model's accuracy. The data on waste contamination are essential for local governments to explore household waste recycling practices besides developing effective waste education and communication methods. The study concludes that waste management 4.0 can be an effective tool for acquiring real-time data; however, overcoming the current limitations needs to be addressed before applying waste management 4.0 into practice."
,11,"The whole world is facing the urgent issue of balancing economic development and ecological conservation. The fulfillment of the solution requires green innovation at the regional level. However, the heterogeneity of green innovation is obvious in different regions. To explore ways at effectively improving the level of regional green innovation in China, the research develops decomposition analysis based on the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to identify the driving factors of green innovation. We also take the Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to explore the driving factors of spatial-temporal heterogeneity of green innovation in China. The main results are as follows. Research and development (R&D) efficiency play a dominant role for increasing regional green patent applications, while environmental regulation contributes the most to a decline of regional green patent applications during 2003-2017. Various determinants of green patent applications exhibit spatial-temporal heterogeneity, such as the coefficients of influencing factors for each province in 2017 being more significant than the same coefficients in 2003. Beijing's coefficient of R&D efficiency is the largest, while the coefficient of economic development for Shanxi is the largest. The findings herein provide detailed insight for China's policymakers to effectively improve the level of regional green innovation domestically, which is of constructive significance to narrow the gap of regional green innovation and realize the coordinated and sustainable development of economy.

,13,"Background Street imagery is a promising and growing big data source providing current and historical images in more than 100 countries. Studies have reported using this data to audit road infrastructure and other built environment features. Here we explore a novel application, using Google Street View (GSV) to predict travel patterns at the city level. Methods We sampled 34 cities in Great Britain. In each city, we accessed 2000 GSV images from 1000 random locations. We selected archived images from time periods overlapping with the 2011 Census and the 2011-2013 Active People Survey (APS). We manually annotated the images into seven categories of road users. We developed regression models with the counts of images of road users as predictors. The outcomes included Census-reported commute shares of four modes (combined walking plus public transport, cycling, motorcycle, and car), as well as APS-reported past-month participation in walking and cycling. Results We found high correlations between GSV counts of cyclists ('GSV-cyclists') and cycle commute mode share (r = 0.92)/past-month cycling (r = 0.90). Likewise, GSV-pedestrians was moderately correlated with past-month walking for transport (r = 0.46), GSV-motorcycles was moderately correlated with commute share of motorcycles (r = 0.44), and GSV-buses was highly correlated with commute share of walking plus public transport (r = 0.81). GSV-car was not correlated with car commute mode share (r = -0.12). However, in multivariable regression models, all outcomes were predicted well, except past-month walking. The prediction performance was measured using cross-validation analyses. GSV-buses and GSV-cyclists are the strongest predictors for most outcomes. Conclusions GSV images are a promising new big data source to predict urban mobility patterns. Predictive power was the greatest for those modes that varied the most (cycle and bus). With its ability to identify mode of travel and capture street activity often excluded in routinely carried out surveys, GSV has the potential to be complementary to new and traditional data. With half the world's population covered by street imagery, and with up to 10 years historical data available in GSV, further testing across multiple settings is warranted both for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments."
